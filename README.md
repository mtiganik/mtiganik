### Hi there 

## Hello, I'm Mihkel ðŸ‘‹

Im a software developer and most of my code I put here. Some of the projects that works best are listed here:

I created some Todo apps in different platforms, check them out

Check out:

<!--
**mtiganik/mtiganik** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
