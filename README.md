### Hi there 

## Hello, I'm Mihkel ðŸ‘‹

Im a software developer and most of my code I put here. Some of the projects that works best are listed here:

I created some Todo apps in different platforms, check them out

Check out: 
- Atari Breakout game. Code [here](https://github.com/mtiganik/atariBreakout) and you can play it [here](https://mtiganik.com/)
- Todo app using React Native + expo, link [here](https://github.com/mtiganik/todo-app-rn-ts)
- Todo app using Flutter, link [here](https://github.com/mtiganik/flutter_todo_app)

* In December I do **Advent of Code challenges**. Last year solutions are here, [Check them out](https://github.com/mtiganik/AdventOfCode2023/)!
* Also, a nice snippet of how to make Roulette board with WPF is [here](https://github.com/mtiganik/Roulette)
<!--
**mtiganik/mtiganik** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
